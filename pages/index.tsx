          Hello,
          I am a skilled freelance developer with over 10 years of experience in the industry. My passion for programming began at a young age and I have always been driven to learn and improve my skills. I completed my Bachelor&apos;s degree in Business Informatics and have a strong background in both frontend and backend development.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have a proven track record of delivering high-quality projects on time and have experience working with a variety of languages and frameworks, including React, TypeScript, and have a strong understanding of SAP ABAP (although I am no longer using it in my current projects). In addition to my technical skills, I have completed coursework in graphic design and have a strong eye for aesthetics. I am also proficient in German and English, which allows me to communicate effectively with clients and team members around the globe.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a digital nomad, I am able to work remotely from anywhere in the world and am committed to providing excellent service to my clients. I am confident that my skills and experience make me a valuable asset for any project and I am eager to take on new challenges.
        </p>
